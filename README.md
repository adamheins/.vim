# .vim
This is my ~/.vim directory.

I use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to install vim
plugins. The plugins can be found in the `bundle/` directory as submodules.
To clone this repository along with all of the plugins, run `git clone
--recursive git@github.com:adamheins/.vim.git`.
